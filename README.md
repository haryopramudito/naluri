Solution
========================================================
1. Calculating Pi to increasing accuracy e.g. 3, 3.1, 3.14, 3.141, 3.1415… etc.
2. Everytime the server has calculated the next decimal precision, it should store
the most accurate value
3. When the server is queried via an HTTP GET request, it will respond with the
most accurate value that the server has calculate
